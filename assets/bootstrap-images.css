Hi there. If you're looking here you're on the right track, but I didn't actually use the Bootstrap framework. 
Shameful, I know. The actual documentation for images within the Bootstrap framework is located here:

http://getbootstrap.com/css/#images

Seriously though, if you found this message it means that you a developer tools champion, which is going to be
way more useful for you long-term than memorizing bootstrap classes anyways :D
