				<h1>Cross-browser Compatibility, Responsive Design, and Frameworks</h1>
				<p>Last week we looked at using simple CSS to change the appearance of a webpage. This week we're looking at some of the situations where CSS is just a little bit more complicated.</p>

				<h1>1. Challenges With HTML/CSS</h1>

				<h2>Cross-Browser Compatibility</h2>

				<p>Unfortunately there is no law that says every browser vendor needs to implement every possible HTML element or CSS property. While HTML and CSS are "standards", ultimately the decision rests with the browser vendors on which features of those standards they will or won't support. In short, no one can force Google, Mozilla, or Apple to modify Chrome, Firefox, or Safari - they have to <em>choose</em> to make the browsers work with the newest HTML and CSS standards.</p>

				<p>For instance, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">the newest version of HTML</a> several <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html5-form-input-type/">new form inputs</a> have been added, including one for picking colors from a pallete. In theory, using the new input element should be simple: you just pop a <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> into your webpage and the user gets a beautiful color selection tool. Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="code">
<span class="tag">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;head&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;title&gt;</span>HTML Color Input Example<span class="tag">&lt;/title&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;body&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;h1&gt;</span>An example form with a color input selector.<span class="tag">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;form&gt;</span>
      <span class="tag">&lt;label for=&quot;example&quot;&gt;</span>Choose a Color: <span class="tag">&lt;input name=&quot;example&quot; type=&quot;color&quot;&gt;</span><span class="tag">&lt;/label&gt;</span>
    <span class="tag">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
  <span class="tag">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span class="tag">&lt;/html&gt;</span>

</pre>

				<p>Should be great right? Well, check out the page in action <a href="../examples/color.html">here</a>. Did it work for you? If you're using Chrome, it should have. As of Monday, February 16th, 2015, here is how it looks in several different browsers:</p>

				<figure>
					<img src="../img/color-picker-chrome.png">
					<figcaption>It seems to work alright in Chrome...</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="../img/color-picker-firefox.png">
					<figcaption>Also looks great in Firefox</figcaption>
				</figure>


				<figure>
					<img src="../img/color-picker-safari.png">
					<figcaption>Ooooh, but something has gone terribly wrong in Safari...</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<p>If you're curious, the website CanIUse.com gives a <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color">great summary</a> of where the new color pallete input does and doesn't work. Since HTML and CSS support in browsers are always changing, tools like <em>Can I Use</em> can be great for learning when it's safe to try out some bleeding edge feature in an actual webpage.</p>

				<figure>
					<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color"><img src="../img/caniuse.png"></a>
					<figcaption>A chart on <em>Can I Use</em> showing which browsers support the color input.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="task">
					<p><strong>Task 1.1:</strong> Visit this <a href="../examples/color.html">example color palette website</a> in each browser on your computer. Does it work the same in all of them? While you're there, make sure you look around the HTML using <em>developer tools</em>, just for practice.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="task">
					<p><strong>Task 1.2:</strong> Try the same color palette website out on your mobile phone (<a href="http://owenscott.github.io/simple/examples/color.html">http://owenscott.github.io/simple/examples/color.html</a>). How does the behaviour of the color picker change? (If it even works at all!)</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Responsive Design</h2>

				<p>A second huge challenge with building non-trivial HTML/CSS websites is getting a website to work seamlessly on different laptops, desktops, mobile phones, and tablets. In the industry, the art of building a site that works well on any device is typically known as "<em>responsive design"</em>. Responsive design is about building a site that is so fluid, it adjusts automatically to any device size.</p>

				<p>Check out <a href="../examples/not-responsive.html">this site</a> on your laptop. Looks pretty reasonable right? Now try checking it out on your mobile phone (<a href="http://bit.ly/1CzAHoL">http://bit.ly/1CzAHoL</a>). Not so reasonable. I'm sure we've all had the experience of trying to book a bus ticket or flight on a mobile phone, and facing the challenge of a site's layout which simply doesn't respond to the device.</p>

				<p>Now visit <a href="../examples/responsive.html">this site</a> on your laptop. Looks the same as the last one, I hope. but try it on your mobile phone (<a href="http://bit.ly/1AdkuqM">http://bit.ly/1AdkuqM</a>). With any luck it should look much better. This is the beauty and simplicity of responsive design.</p>

				<div class="task">
					<p><strong>Task 1.3:</strong> Visit the <a href="../examples/not-responsive.html">non-responsive</a> and <a href="../examples/responsive.html">responsive</a> demo sites on your laptop and use <em>developer tools</em> to look at the HTML and CSS. Can you find the differences between the CSS for the responsive and unresponsive pages?</p>
				</div>

				<div class="task">
					<p><strong>Task 1.4:</strong> A great simple way to test if a page is responsive is to resize the browser window horizontally. Visit the <a href="../examples/responsive.html">responsive page</a> above and resize the browser window horizontally (left to right). Watch how the layout changes once you reach a certain width.</p>
				</div>


				<div class="task">
					<p><strong>Task 1.5 (Bonus):</strong> A lot of front-end web developers obsessively resize browser windows to test if webpages are responsive. A lot of developers also know that developers do this, so they throw in little surprises. For a great example, visit <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Stuff And Nonsense</a> and slowly resize the browser from narrow to wide.</p>
				</div>


				<h1>2. Frameworks</h1>

				<p>Hopefully by now you've realized that HTML and CSS can be very tough to get right on any non-trivial website. Further, because browsers, devices, and the HTML/CSS standards are always changing, you need to be constantly testing your site in dozens of device-browser permutations. You can see how things can get out-of-hand quickly.</p>
				<p>For this reason, many developers use <em>frameworks</em>. Frameworks are pre-made combinations of HTML and CSS that you can use for quickly designing and building sites.</p>
				<p>Using a framework is different from writing your own CSS. Typically to use a framework you download a CSS file from the framework's website, and include it with your webpage. Then, instead of writing your own CSS, you simply use classnames provided by that framework. For instance, using the Bootstrap framework, <code>&lt;p class=&quot;text-danger&quot;&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</code> will automatically style a paragraphs text in red, as a warning to the user. (Which you can use, for instance, when you're trying to flag that they filled out a form incorrectly). Frameworks typically provide a huge number of CSS classes that you can use directly in your HTML, eliminating the need to write CSS yourself.</p>

				<p>In this class we will be using the Bootstrap framework. However, if you are curious about what other frameworks exist check out <a href="http://usablica.github.io/front-end-frameworks/compare.html">this page</a> for an exhaustive list.</p>

				<div class="task">
					<p><strong>Task 2.1:</strong> Take a look at the <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/">Bootstrap documentation</a>. Can you find the different CSS class names that you can use for styling an image? What class name would you use if you wanted to give an image a rounded border like this one?</p>

				<h1>Learn More</h1>
				<p>At this point our course diverges slightly. The rest of the CFG focuses on the Bootstrap framework. You'll be spending less time writing your own CSS, and more time learning to use one of the most popular and powerful frameworks out there. However, if you want to do your own deep-dive into writing your own modern CSS and responsive design, here are some resources:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://learnlayout.com/">Learn Layout</a>. This site is slightly more advanced than what we've tackled in class, but provides a really thorough introduction to all of the ways to build your own modern, responsive CSS layout from scratch.</li>
					<li><a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design, the book.</a> An instant classic which literally launched the responsive design paradigm in 2011. Great read.</li>
					<li><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/html-css">Codeschool's CSS/HTML Pathway</a>. This is more advanced than General Assembly (and costs a bit of cash) but is a fantastic resource for "leveling up" your HTML/CSS skills to intermediate.</li>
