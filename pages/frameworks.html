				<h1>Challenges With HTML/CSS</h1>

				<h2>Cross-Browser Compatibility</h2>

				<p>Unfortunately there is no law that says every browser vendor needs to implement every possible HTML element or CSS property. While HTML and CSS are "standards", ultimately the decision rests with the browser vendors on which features of those standards they will or won't support. In short, no one can force Google, Mozilla, or Apple to modify Chrome, Firefox, or Safari - they have to <em>choose</em> to make the browsers work with the newest HTML and CSS standards.</p>

				<p>For instance, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5">the newest version of HTML</a> several <a href="http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/html5-form-input-type/">new form inputs</a> have been added, including one for picking colors from a pallete. In theory, using the new input element should be simple: you just pop a <code>&lt;input type="color"&gt;</code> into your webpage and the user gets a beautiful color selection tool. Here is an example:</p>

<pre class="code">
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;HTML Color Input Example&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;An example form with a color input selector.&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
      &lt;label for=&quot;example&quot;&gt;Choose a Color: &lt;input name=&quot;example&quot; type=&quot;color&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</pre>

				<p>Should be great right? Well, check out the page in action <a href="../examples/color.html">here</a>. Did it work for you? If you're using Chrome, it should have. As of Monday, February 16th, 2015, here is how it looks in several different browsers:</p>
