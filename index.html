				<h1>A Pretty Simple Website</h1>
				<p>Most real websites are messy. They are full of scripts, stylesheets, hidden sections, search-engine-optimization (SEO), and all kinds of other miscellaneous HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Looking through the source code of real websites can be intimidating or confusing, even for people who have a lot of experience.</p>
				<p>This website is intentionally simple. Hopefuly it's simplicity will make it easier to understand how you can examine a live website.</p>

				<h1>An Exercise</h1>

				<h2>Part 1: Find the Page Source</h2>
				<p>There are two ways to look at a web page's <em>source code</em>. Firstly, tou can open up the entire page's source code in a new tab in your browser. Alternatively, you can use your browser's <em>Developer Tools</em> to explore the page's source interactively. Both approaches are shown in the figures below.</p>

				<div class="task"><p><strong>Task 1.1:</strong> Use both <em>View Source</em> and <em>Developer Tools</em> to look at the source code for this webpage</p></div>
				
				<h2>Part 2: Specific Tasks</h2>
				<div class="task"><p><strong>Task 2.1:</strong> Can you figure out which HTML element is used to make the words "Task 2.1" bold in this sentence?</p></div>
				<div class="task"><p><strong>Task 2.2:</strong> Can you figure out what CSS class is used to share formatting between all of the "Task" boxes?</p></div>
				<div class="task"><p><strong>Task 2.3:</strong> Can you find the actual CSS code being used to style the Task elements? Where is it located?</p></div>
				<div class="task"><p><strong>Task 2.4:</strong> Click on the button below. What happens? Can you find the relevant JavaScript code?</p></div>

			</section>

			<section id="button">
				<button onclick="doSomething()">Click Me!!!</button>
			</section>

		<script>
			
			function doSomething() {
				alert('Hello');
			}
			
			// yup, this is the code that made the button work for Task 2.4. good job finding it!
			// as a side note, using "onclick" is considered pretty low-brow, but
			// I wanted to keep this example simple :)
